# bank-account-icons

Icons for banks, that let you configure the look of your accounts (e.g. bunq).
I will add more icons as I make them.
Feel free to use these files as you want. These files are released into the public domain.

## Folders

There are "theme" folders for the source files (rainbow, solid,...) and an output folder, where these source files are exported to 1024px PNGs.

### rainbow

A theme with a rainbow gradient and solid background colors.

### solid

A theme with sold background and foreground colors.
