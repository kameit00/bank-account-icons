# bank-account-icons

Icons for banks, that let you configure the look of your accounts (e.g. bunq).
I will add more icons as I make them.
Feel free to use these files as you want. These files are released into the public domain.

[Download](https://github.com/kameit00/bank-account-icons/tree/master/output)

## Folders

The `output` folder contains the files as 1024x1024 pixel PNGs. The source file for these exported icons is `icons.afdesign` ([Affinity Designer](http://affinity.serif.com/designer/))

## If you want to say tank you

If you want to say thank you, you can buy me some chocolate if you want.
Here is the link to my bunq account:

But to be honest, if you enjoy the icons it's more than enough for me. I just wanted to try out my 'bunq.me' link ;-)
